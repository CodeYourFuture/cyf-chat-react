#### Your UI should at least:

- [ ] Display the latest messages on load
- [ ] Provide a "see latest" button to fetch and display the latest messages
- [ ] Provide a "delete" button or a clickable icon next to each message.
  - [ ] When clicked this should delete the message from the server and then from the local display.

#### Optionally, your UI may also:

- [ ] Load and re-display the latest messages every 30 seconds.
- [ ] Allow the user to use as much as possible of the back-end that you developed in levels 1-4 (e.g. message search).
